# Five-bash-programs

## Overview
A collection of five Bash scripts that demonstrate fundamental Bah scripting techniques, including user interaction, countdown timers, random number generation, fortune telling, and loop structures. Each program is designed to automate tasks and enhance your terminal experience.

## Program 1: Questionnaire

### Summary
The Questionnaire program engages the user by asking three questions: their name, location, and favorite coding website. After gathering the inputs, it constructs and displays a personalized message. This program illustrates basic input handling using the `read` command in Bash.

## Program 2: Countdown
### Summary
The Countdown program counts down from a specified positive integer, which is provided as an argument. If the input is valid (greater than zero), it uses a loop to decrement the number, displaying each value with a one-second pause. This demonstrates control structures and user input validation in Bash.

### Summary
The Fortune Teller program prompts the user to ask a yes or no question and provides a random fortune response from a predefined set of answers. It ensures that the input question ends with a question mark by using a loop that requests re-entry if necessary. This program highlights input validation and the use of functions in Bash.


## Program 5: Run All Programs

### Summary
This script is a simple wrapper that sequentially executes the other four programs. By calling each script in order, it allows users to experience all functionalities at once. 


## Conclusion

These scripts provide a foundation for understanding Bash programming concepts. Users are encouraged to modify and expand upon these examples for their own purposes.
